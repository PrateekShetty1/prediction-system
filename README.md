Welcome to the Therapist Dashboard Prediction System! This system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques from the NLTK library to assess the sentiments of therapy sessions for each patient. Additionally, it showcases trends and performs predictions using AutoML through the H2O library.

## Overview

The Therapist Dashboard Prediction System is designed to assist therapists in analyzing and understanding the emotional dynamics of their therapy sessions. By leveraging NLP and AutoML techniques, the system provides insights into the sentiments expressed during sessions and offers predictive analytics to anticipate future trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this system has been simulated for demonstration purposes. It includes data for 10 sessions of a single patient. Each session contains:

- Assessment scores: Numeric scores recorded by the therapist to evaluate the patient's progress.
- Session notes: Any additional notes or observations made by the therapist during the session.
- Transcripts: Textual transcripts of the interactions between the therapist and the patient during each session.
Please note that this dataset is generated for illustrative purposes and may not reflect real patient data.

## Functionality

### Sentiment Analysis
The system performs sentiment analysis on the transcripts of each session using NLTK. It evaluates the emotional tone of the conversation and categorizes it as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis helps therapists understand the overall sentiment trends across sessions.

### Trend Visualization
The system visualizes sentiment trends over the 10 sessions, allowing therapists to identify patterns and fluctuations in the patient's emotional state. Graphical representations provide an intuitive way to interpret the data and track progress over time.

### Predictive Analytics
Using H2O's AutoML capabilities, the system generates predictive models based on the historical session data. These models forecast future sentiment trends and enable therapists to anticipate potential shifts in the patient's emotional well-being. Predictive analytics empower therapists to take proactive measures and tailor their interventions accordingly.

## Conclusion

The Therapist Dashboard Prediction System offers a comprehensive toolkit for therapists to analyze, visualize, and predict the emotional dynamics of therapy sessions. By harnessing the power of NLP and AutoML, the system empowers therapists to make data-driven decisions and provide targeted support to their patients.

It's important to note that due to the relatively small size of the dataset, the accuracy of the AutoML predictions may be limited. Further optimization and refinement of the predictive models are necessary to improve accuracy and reliability. Therapists should exercise caution and interpret the predictions with consideration for their limitations.
